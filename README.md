# Bohemian Rhapsody
## Queen


*1*<br>
Is this the real life?<br>
Is this just fantasy?<br>
Caught in a landslide<br>
No escape from reality<br>
Open your eyes<br>
Look up to the skies and see<br>
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy<br>
Because I'm easy come, easy go<br>
A little high, little low<br>
Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me, to me.<br>





### 2<br>
Mama, just killed a man<br>
Put a gun against his head<br>
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead<br>
Mama, life had just begun<br>
But now I've gone and thrown it all away<br>
Mama, oh oh<br>
Didn't mean to make you cry<br>
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow<br>
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters<br>


### 4
I see a little silhouetto of a man<br>
Scaramouch, Scaramouch will you do the Fandango<br>
Thunderbolt and lightning very very frightening me<br>
Gallileo, Gallileo, Gallileo, Gallileo, Gallileo, figaro, magnifico<br>

### 5
I'm just a poor boy and nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come easy go will you let me go


### 6
Bismillah, no we will not let you go, let him go
Bismillah, we will not let you go, let him go
Bismillah, we will not let you go, let me go
(Will not let you go) let me go (never, never let you go) let me go (never let me go)
Oh oh no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me for me for me


### 7
So you think you can stop me and spit in my eye
So you think you can love me and leave me to die
Oh baby can't do this to me baby
Just gotta get out just gotta get right outta here

---*8*----
oh oh yeah, oh oh yeah
Nothing really matters
Anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me
Anyway the wind blows







-----------3--------------
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine
Body's a ching all the time
Goodbye everybody i've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, oh oh (anyway the wind blows)
I don't want to die
Sometimes wish i'd never been born at all
