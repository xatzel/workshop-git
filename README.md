# Bohemian Rhapsody
## Queen

---*1*----
Is this the real life?
Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide
No escape from reality
Open your eyes
Look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go
A little high, little low
Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me, to me.

## oh oh yeah, oh oh yeah
# Nothing really matters
# Anyone can see
# Nothing really matters
# Nothing really matters to me
# Anyway the wind blows
